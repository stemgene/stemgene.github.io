Scientists work to Genetically modify crops for various reasons. Sometimes the goal may be to develop a crop that **is resistant to** disease or pesticides. Another goal is to develop vegetables that have a longer **shelf life**. Or, the purpose may be to develop a more nutritious form of a food plant. **An explample of the latter** is golden rice. It was developed by scientists in Europe. They took ordinary rice and **inserted genes** from the yellow flower called daffodil, as well as from a bacterium. This gave the rice the golden color **from which it gets its name**. **More to the point**, however, it added Vitamin A, a nutrient that rice does not normally have.
