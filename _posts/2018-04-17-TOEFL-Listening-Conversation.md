*** TPO 1# With a Librarian

S: I really hope you can help me.  
L: That's why I am here. What can I do for you?  
S: **I'm supposed to do** a literature review for my psycology course, but having a hard time finding articles. I don't even know where to **start looking**.  
L: You said this is for your psycology course, right? So your focus is on...  
S: **Dream Interpretation**.  
L: Well, you have a focus, so that's already a good start. Have you check to see if your professor **put any materials for you to look at on reserve**?   
S: That's one thing I did know to do. I just copied an article, but I still need three more on my topic from three different journals.  
L: Let's get you going on looking for those then. We have printed versions of 20 years old psycolgy journals in the Reference Section. These are the ones published within the last year. Then I think about it... there's a journal named Sleep and Dream.  
S: Oh, yeah, the article I just copied is from that journal, so I've got to look other sources.  
L: OK, actually most of our material are avaliable electronically now. You can access psycology database or electronic journals and articles through the library's computers, and if you want to search by title with the word "dream" for example, just type it in and all the articles with "dream" in the title will come up on the screen.   
S: Too bad I can't do this home.  
L: But you can. All of the labrary's database and electronic resouces can **be accessed** through any computer connected to the university network.  
S: Really? I can't believe I didn't know that. It still sounds like it's going to take a while though, you know, going through all the information, all of the sources.  
L: May be. But you already **narrow your search down** to article on dream interpertation, so it should not be too bad. And you probably notice that there is an abstract or summary at the top of first page of the article you copied. When you **go into** the databases or electronic sources, you have the options to display the abstract on the computer screen, skimming those to decide whether or not you want to read the whole article should cut down some time.  
S: Right, abstacts! They'll definately **make the project more doable**. I guess I should try out electronic search while I'm still here then, you know, just in case.   
L: That computer is for you over there. I'll be here till five this afternoon.
S: Thanks, I feel a lot better about this assignment now.
